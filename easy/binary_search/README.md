# Binary Search
Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise -1.

If you're unfamiliar with Binary Search, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.

### Input
```js
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
target = 33
```

### Output
```js
3
```

## Instructions
1. You need to complete the function answer on `answer.js` file.
2. The function should return the index of the target integer if it is contained in the array, otherwise -1.
3. Run the tests to see the results `node run`
