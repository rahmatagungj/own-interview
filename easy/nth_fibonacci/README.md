# Nth Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to F0, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to F1, etc..

### Input
```js
n = 6
```

### Output
```js
5 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

## Instructions
1. You need to complete the function getNthFib on `getNthFib.js` file.
2. Function `getNthFib` should return an integer.
3. Run the tests to see the results `node run`
