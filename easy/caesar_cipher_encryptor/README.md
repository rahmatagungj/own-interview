# Caesar Cipher Encryptor
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.

Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter `z` shifted by one returns the letter `a`.

### Input
```js
string = "xyz"
key = 2
```

### Output
```js
"zab"
```

## Instructions
1. You need to complete the function caesarCipherEncryptor on `caesarCipherEncryptor.js` file.
2. The function should return a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.
