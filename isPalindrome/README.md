# Palindrome Check 
Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

### Input
```js
string = "abcdcba"
```

### Output
```js
true
```

## Instructions
1. You need to complete the function isPalindrome on `isPalindrome.js` file.
2. The function should return true if the given string is a palindrome, otherwise it should return false.
3. Run the tests to see the results `node run`
